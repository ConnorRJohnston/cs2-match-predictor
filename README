# CS2 Match Predictor

This repository contains a simple command line application for predicting Counter-Strike 2 match outcomes using an Elo rating system.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (none besides Python standard library).
2. Run the predictor with the provided sample dataset:

```bash
python -m cs2_match_predictor.main sample_matches.csv FaZe G2
```

The script will output the probability of the first team beating the second team based on Elo ratings calculated from the dataset.

You can add more historical match results to `sample_matches.csv` or provide your own CSV file with the columns:

```
team1,team2,team1_score,team2_score
```

Update the dataset with recent matches to improve predictions.
