# CS2 Match Predictor

This repository contains a simple command line application for predicting Counter-Strike 2 match outcomes using an Elo rating system.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the command-line predictor with the provided sample dataset:
