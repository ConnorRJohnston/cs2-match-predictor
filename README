# CS2 Match Predictor

This repository contains a simple command line application for predicting Counter-Strike 2 match outcomes using an Elo rating system.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the command-line predictor using the included dataset of real match results:

```bash
python -m cs2_match_predictor.main FaZe G2
```

The script will output the probability of the first team beating the second team based on Elo ratings calculated from `data/csgoresults.csv`.

The file `data/csgoresults.csv` contains thousands of real CS2 match results and was downloaded from the [csgo-dataset](https://github.com/hojlund123/csgo-dataset) project.

You can also provide your own CSV file with the columns:

```
team1,team2,team1_score,team2_score
```

Update the dataset with recent matches to improve predictions.

## Web Front End

You can also run a simple web interface:

```bash
python -m cs2_match_predictor.webapp
```
